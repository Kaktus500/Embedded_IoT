/* J1.6 P4.3
RSLK BMP2 (bumper switch 2), switch to ground and software internal pullup
BP-BASSENSORSMKII Sensor HDC_V+
Conflict: cannot use both HDC2080 Temperature/Humidity Sensor and bump switch BMP2
Resolution:
a) To use the HDC2080 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and not BMP2: Make P4.3 a GPIO output low to power the Sensor (BMP2 has no functionality if the switch is pressed or released). The software will not have the functionality of being able to turn off power to HDC2080, because if the software makes P4.3 GPIO output high and the user activates BMP2, then P4.3 output high will be shorted to ground. Do not make P4.3 a GPIO output high and then press BMP2.
b) To use BMP2 and not the HDC2080 Temperature and Humidity Sensor: Make P4.3 a GPIO input from BMP2 (pressing BMP2 temporarily powers HDC2080 Temperature and Humidity Sensor).

J3.23 P6.1
RSLK DISTC (analog input from center distance sensor)
BP-BASSENSORSMKII Sensor HDC_INT
Conflict: you cannot use both HDC_INT on the HDC2080 and RSLK DISTC
this is disconnected by default unless the user attached an analog signal here, which will probably need to be disconnected to use the interrupt pin HDC_INT on the HDC2080 Temperature and Humidity Sensor (disabled by default)
