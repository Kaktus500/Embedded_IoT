"""
This program implements a BLE controller for the MSP432/CC2650. 
The keys are used to read and write characteristics 
The Switch 1 is updated with a notification, switch values are plotted and saved to file. 
"""

"""
Requirements: 
Python 3.9
bleak 0.13.0
pygame 2.0.2

Run the following command to install the libraries
'pip install bleak==0.13.0 pygame==2.0.2'
"""

"""
Usage:
Run the script using the following command
'py ap_ble.py'

Once running it will attempt to connect to the MSP432/CC2650 
and once connected a GUI window will appear plotting Switch1 vs time
Type
 0-7 to set LED color
 s to read switch value
 Esc to quit
Switch1 versus time will also be logged into switch.txt file
